This project documents my implementation of Neural Style Transfer using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Introduction

Neural Style Transfer is an AI technique that allows us to combine the content of one image with the artistic style of another. This project explores both the theory behind the algorithm and a practical implementation.

> **What is Neural Style Transfer?**  
> Neural Style Transfer (NST) uses Convolutional Neural Networks to separate and recombine the *content* and *style* of images. It was first introduced by Gatys et al. in their 2015 paper **A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style**.

---

## Theory

Neural Style Transfer works by manipulating the internal representations of a pre-trained CNN (such as VGG19). The algorithm optimizes an output image to match:

1. Content representations of the content image  
2. Style representations of the style image

### Content Representation

Content is represented by activations in higher layers of the CNN, which capture the high-level structure but not the exact pixel values.

> ðŸ’¡ In a CNN, deeper layers capture more abstract features. Earlier layers capture edges and textures, while later layers represent complex objects and structures.

### Style Representation

Style is captured using the Gram matrix of layer activations, which measures feature correlations.

```python
def gram_matrix(input_tensor):
    result = tf.linalg.einsum('bijc,bijd->bcd', input_tensor, input_tensor)
    input_shape = tf.shape(input_tensor)
    num_locations = tf.cast(input_shape[1] * input_shape[2], tf.float32)
    return result / num_locations
```

## Implementation

Our implementation uses TensorFlow and Keras with the pre-trained VGG19 model.

### Setup Environment

First, let's install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-hub numpy pillow matplotlib
```

### Loading the Model

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import vgg19

vgg = vgg19.VGG19(include_top=False, weights='imagenet')
vgg.trainable = False

content_layers = ['block5_conv2']
style_layers = ['block1_conv1', 'block2_conv1', 'block3_conv1', 'block4_conv1', 'block5_conv1']

model = tf.keras.Model([vgg.input], [vgg.get_layer(name).output for name in style_layers + content_layers])
```

### Image Loading and Processing

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def load_and_process_image(image_path):
    img = Image.open(image_path).resize((512, 512))
    img = np.array(img).astype(np.float32)
    img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)
    return vgg19.preprocess_input(img)

def deprocess_image(processed_img):
    x = processed_img.copy()
    x = x.reshape((512, 512, 3))
    x[:, :, 0] += 103.939
    x[:, :, 1] += 116.779
    x[:, :, 2] += 123.68
    x = x[:, :, ::-1]
    return np.clip(x, 0, 255).astype('uint8')
```

## Optimization

To generate the stylized image, we define a loss function that combines content and style loss, and we optimize the image using gradient descent.

```python
@tf.function
def compute_loss(model, loss_weights, init_image, gram_style_features, content_features):
    style_weight, content_weight = loss_weights

    model_outputs = model(init_image)
    style_output_features = model_outputs[:len(style_layers)]
    content_output_features = model_outputs[len(style_layers):]

    style_score = 0
    content_score = 0

    for target_style, comb_style in zip(gram_style_features, style_output_features):
        style_score += tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(comb_style - target_style))

    for target_content, comb_content in zip(content_features, content_output_features):
        content_score += tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(comb_content - target_content))

    style_score *= style_weight
    content_score *= content_weight
    loss = style_score + content_score
    return loss
```

The optimization is done using an optimizer like Adam or L-BFGS to iteratively update the image.

## Applications

- **Artistic Filters**: Create personalized artwork using photographs and paintings.
- **Content Creation**: Enhance visual content for marketing, media, and education.
- **Augmented Reality**: Apply style transfer in real-time on mobile devices.

## Conclusion

Neural Style Transfer is a powerful and creative use of deep learning. By leveraging pre-trained convolutional networks and carefully balancing style and content loss, we can generate visually stunning results.

Future improvements include:

1. Real-time NST using lightweight models
2. Video style transfer
3. User-controlled stylization strength and region targeting
