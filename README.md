This repository contains the source code for my personal website (https://hassanshahir.com). It's a very old school, minimalist, Notion-like static site built with pure HTML and inline CSS.

## Compatible with GitHub Pages
A `.nojekyll` file is included in the root to disable Jekyll processing so that all files (even those with underscores) are served as-is. So you can host it for free using Github pages. ;)
