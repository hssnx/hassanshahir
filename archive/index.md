Hello World, welcome to my little corner of the internet. If you’ve stumbled across this site and like what you see, that’s great! For me, it’s just a personal archive.

I’m Hassan. I like tech, philosophy, sleep, and working on my ideas. I’m 18. I go to school. I code. I read. I build & break and I think... (a lot).

Here, I share my thoughts & readings ([essays](/essays/)), and what I’m working on ([projects](/projects/)). If you find something worthwhile here, that’s a bonus.
