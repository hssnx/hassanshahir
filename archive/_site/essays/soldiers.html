    <div class="article-content">
      <p>In my opinion, politics are filthy, corrupt, and self-serving, and they are the reason why, in modern times, those soldiers are fighting on the frontlines. And it is really absurd to think about it—the soldiers who are fighting on the frontlines are just ordinary people, just like you, me, and the guy working at the supermarket. They have families, friends, lovers. They were not born to be killers. Society, as always, simplifies everything, turning war into some ridiculous “good vs. evil” narrative. It’s dogshit. Because reality does not work that way. And the more I think about it, the more absurd it gets. In my opinion, war is never as simple as “us vs. them.”</p>

<p>For so long, we have only seen one side of the coin. For example, Russian soldiers? The enemy. The invaders. The bad guys. But to the politicians who send them to war, they are just numbers—pawns in a larger chess game. That is all they ever were and will be. And I have thought about this a lot; if you actually step outside of the script we have been fed, if you actually take a moment to look at the people we call enemies, listen to their music, understand their emotions, you start seeing it. The whole thing is a system. These soldiers, the ones we have been conditioned to hate, are just like us. Stuck in the same web, trapped under the same system. They are not the real monsters. The real monsters that will drink your blood with joy are sitting in nice, cozy government offices, in luxury villas, behind polished desks, while playing war like it is some strategy game.</p>

<p>For example, think about the Soviet-Afghan War, the last twenty years of fighting between Afghan soldiers and the Taliban, or the recent Ukraine-Russia War. It is the same thing all over again. None of these soldiers wanted to spend their lives killing other people. Yet, the war never stopped. Why? Because those filthy, bloodthirsty puppet masters kept pulling the strings. The politicians, the warlords, the foreign interests—all of them were working together to keep the fire burning. That is how war works. The people who actually fight, the real people who are suffering in trenches like wild animals, never have and never will have a real choice. They are just pieces on a board. Government troops, Taliban fighters, foreign soldiers—it does not matter. For politicians, they are all just bodies to be moved, sacrificed, and replaced with new recruits in the name of nationalism, religion, and power. What I personally see is just different uniforms, same fate. Their lives were never theirs to begin with. The real decisions were made by the ones who never touched the battlefield. The ones who created the war, fed it, profited from it, and watched from a safe distance while the rest of us bled.</p>

<p>I have thought about this so many times, and it always leads me to the same conclusion. Every soldier, no matter which side they fought for, would have chosen something else if they could—a normal life, a family, a job, peace. No one actually wants to kill unless they are left with no other choice. And that is what has always disgusted me the most. Never hate on poor soldiers. It is not them. It is the people who play god: the politicians, the warlords, the elites who sit at the top, untouched, while the rest of us are thrown into the fire. They make the rules. They move the pieces. And they never pay the price.</p>
