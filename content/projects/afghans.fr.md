### Project Overview

Afghans.fr is an upcoming platform aimed at unifying the Afghan diaspora in France. The initial launch will take place in Nancy, with plans to expand to other cities (e.g., nancy.afghans.fr, paris.afghans.fr). The platform's mission is to simplify the process for newly arriving Afghans to find employment, seek assistance, contribute to the community, and build meaningful social connections. This will be achieved within a transparent, member-driven, and self-sustaining ecosystem.
