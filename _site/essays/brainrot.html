    <div class="article-content">
      <p>I have thought about this a lot, and honestly, this whole obsession with celebrity culture is just dogshit. People spend their lives glorifying actors, athletes, and influencers, as if they are gods, as if their existence somehow adds value to the world. It is really absurd to see people measure value by how much money was wasted on weddings, parties, and luxury nonsense—just so they can talk about it, impress each other with useless conversations, and feel important for knowing things that do not matter.</p>

<p>This entire rotten system of celebrity worship has turned people into empty, brain-rotten creatures who live through others. If only half this energy were spent on real things—on science, innovation, education—maybe, just maybe, the world would not be so damn pathetic. But no, society chooses to drool over celebrities while ignoring everything that actually matters.</p>

<p>I think about places like Afghanistan, where millions are poured into cricket while the education system rots. Thousands of people will fill stadiums for sports, but when schools shut down and innocent girls are banned from education, they say nothing. They will camp outside a wedding hall just to catch a glimpse of a famous cricketer’s wedding party, yet will not stand up against real injustice. The hypocrisy is staggering, and priorities are completely f***ed.</p>
